\subsection{Choice of Topic}
As the Mpemba effect implies that initially hotter water freezes faster than colder water, it naturally follows that identifying the circumstances under which this takes place might give rise to some important implications for the practice. Concretely, Mpemba effect might be used to speed up certain processes, ranging from simple instances of making ice-cream where Mpemba first observed the effect to more advanced cases. Additionally, furthering the research and challenging the reproducibility of this topic might lead to a better understanding of the Mpemba effect. Finally, more research might prove useful for settling the existing disagreements in the scientific communities surrounding the origin of the effect itself. 

\subsection{Research Question}
In order to further explore the Mpemba Effect this essay will look into the \emph{Theory of Solutes} and consider its applicability in explaining the phenomenon using a specific case. More precisely, this work will consider (a) \textbf{whether the initial temperatures influence the speed of cooling} and (b) \textbf{how different concentrations of the NaCl solute affect the occurrence of the Mpemba Effect?} \par
