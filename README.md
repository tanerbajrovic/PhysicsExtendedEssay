# ExtendedEssay
Here's an Extended Essay in Physics I cid as part of the International Baccalaurate Diploma Programme (2019-2021). I've included my code for measurments 
and LaTeX source codes I used to typeset the essay. 

Although I received an A (lower bound), I realize that I didn't do a good job with a lot of things. Regardless, I think that this repo may be useful for figuring out the structure of your EE or looking up some LaTeX code.

Good luck with your EE.
